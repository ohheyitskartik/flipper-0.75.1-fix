Summary:\nReleasing version $VERSION\n\n\
Test Plan:\n\
1. Flipper Bot will comment \"#flipperrelease ephemeral\" to trigger a new ephemeral release job [\"flipper-release-ephemeral\"](https://fburl.com/sandcastle/4mt4rj18) on Sandcastle.\n\
1. After the job has finished, Flipper Bot will post to the Signal Hub the command to run the produced build with the exact version:\n\
\`env FLIPPERVERSIONV2=<FLIPPERVERSION> RUST_LOG=flipper_launcher=info /Applications/Flipper.app/Contents/MacOS/Flipper\`\n\
1. Run the build and perform exploratory tests.\n\
1. If everything is ok, accept and land the diff.\n\
1. After the diff has landed, Flipper Bot will comment \"#flipperrelease with bump\" to trigger the actual release build job [\"flipper-release\"](https://fburl.com/sandcastle/uh698xj2) on Sandcastle.\n\
1. After the job has finished, a new diff will be published for pinning the released version to the fbsource checkout, check further instructions in that diff.\n\
1. In case the release job has failed, Flipper Bot will post to the Signal Hub. In addition to that, the \"flipper\" oncall will receive an e-mail and a task for investigation.\n\n\
See more details about the Flipper release process [here](https://fburl.com/flipperreleasebot).\n\
