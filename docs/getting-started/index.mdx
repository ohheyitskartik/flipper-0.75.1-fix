Flipper helps you debug Android and iOS apps running in an emulator/simulator or connected physical development devices. Flipper consists of two parts:

- The desktop app
- The native mobile SDKs for Android and iOS

Once you start Flipper and launch an emulator/simulator or connect a device, you'll start to see the device logs (and any other device-level plugins that work with your device).

To see app specific data, you need to integrate the Flipper SDK into your app. See the relevant section in the sidebar for how to do that.

## Installation

<OssOnly>

The desktop part of Flipper doesn't need any particular setup. Simply download the latest build for [Mac](https://www.facebook.com/fbflipper/public/mac), [Linux](https://www.facebook.com/fbflipper/public/linux) or [Windows](https://www.facebook.com/fbflipper/public/windows) and launch it.

In order to work properly, Flipper requires a working installation of the Android and (if where applicable) iOS development tools on your system, as well as the [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org) binary on your `$PATH`.

A compatible OpenSSL for Windows can be downloaded [here](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) or from Chocolatey with `choco install openssl`.
