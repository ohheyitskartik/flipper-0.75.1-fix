## Publishing to npm

Flipper plugins are essentially standard npm packages. So you can publish them by executing `yarn publish` or `npm publish` in the plugin directory. The only requirements are:

1. `package.json` and code [must follow the Flipper plugin specification](desktop-plugin-structure#plugin-definition)
2. code must be bundled using "flipper-pkg" before packing or publishing. This can be done by executing `flipper-pkg bundle` on `prepack` step:
    ```
    {
      ...
      "devDependencies": {
        ...
        "flipper-pkg": "latest"
      },
      "scripts": {
        ...
        "prepack": "flipper-pkg bundle"
      }
    }
    ```

## Packaging to File

To package plugin as a tarball, you can use the same command as for packaging any other npm package, e.g. `yarn pack` or `npm pack`.

"flipper-pkg" also provides a convenient command `pack` which:

1. Installs the plugin dependencies
2. Bundles the plugin
3. Creates the tarball and saves it at the specified location

E.g. to package plugin located at `~/flipper-plugins/my-plugin` to `~/Desktop`, execute the following command:
```
flipper-pkg pack ~/flipper-plugins/my-plugin -o ~/Desktop
```

## Installation from File

It is possible to install plugins into Flipper from tarballs. This is useful in cases when you need to try a plugin version which is not published to npm, or if you want to distribute plugin privately:

1. Launch Flipper
2. Click the "Manage Plugins" button in the bottom-left corner
3. Select the "Install Plugins" tab in the opened sheet
4. Specify the path to the plugin package (or just drag and drop it) and click "Install"
