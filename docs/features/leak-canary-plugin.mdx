The LeakCanary plugin provides developers with Flipper support for [LeakCanary](https://github.com/square/leakcanary), an open source memory leak detection library.

Leaks detected by LeakCanary will appear automatically in Flipper. Each leak will display a hierarchy of objects, beginning from the garbage collector root and ending at the leaked class.
Selecting any object in this list will display contents of the object's various fields.

Note: this plugin is only available for Android.
